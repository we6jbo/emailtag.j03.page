# 📧 EmailTag: Smarter Gmail +tagging for a Cleaner Inbox

Welcome to **EmailTag**, a Chrome extension that lets you automatically generate Gmail `+tags`, track where you've used your email, and organize your inbox like a pro.

---

## 🚀 What This Extension Does
- ✅ **Generate Gmail +tagged addresses** (e.g. `joneal97m+shop@gmail.com`)
- 🔍 **Identify who’s sharing your email** by tracking where each tag was used
- 🗃️ **Organize your inbox** with auto-tagged variations like `+newsletter`, `+career`, `+tools`
- 🔄 **A/B testing and CRM-style tracking** support coming soon
- 🔧 Easy future-proof updates via GitHub

---

## 💡 Why I Made This
I wanted a **simple, powerful tool** to:
- Instantly know who sold or leaked my email address
- Organize trial accounts, newsletters, and services
- Test engagement with different versions of emails

Instead of guessing where spam came from, I wanted **proof.** Gmail's `+tag` feature gives that — and EmailTag automates it.
